# Hello, I am YusufYaser!

You may know me from many places (most likely from Discord), but you have made your way to my GitHub profile!

# What do I do here?

I well... write code! Most of my repositories are simply just for fun. ~~ignoring that there isn't much right now~~\
You can check them out, use them or just see the code and tell me if there is an issue that I did not notice.

# What am I focused at?

I am focused on backend development, and I am a bit decent on frontend development.
