# Hello, I am YusufYaser!

You may know me from many places (most likely from Discord), but you have made your way to my GitHub profile!

## What do I do here?

I well... write code! Most of my repositories are simply just for fun. ~~ignoring that there isn't much right now~~

You can check them out, use them or just see the code and tell me if there is an issue that I did not notice.

## What do I like?

Besides IT, I like playing games like Minecraft and Grand Theft Auto V.

I like helping people with their problems.

## How do I reach you?

You can reach me via Discord (@YusufYaser#7242).\
You can also reach me via [email](mailto:me@yusufyaser.xyz)!

I have a [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/RealYusufYaser) too!
